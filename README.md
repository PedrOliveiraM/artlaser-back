## Introduction

The API Backend is responsible for handling all the requests from the frontend and interacting with the database to retrieve and manipulate data. It follows RESTful principles and provides a secure and efficient way to communicate with the ArtLaser application.

## Authentication

To access the API endpoints, you need to authenticate using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The authentication process involves sending a POST request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with valid credentials. Upon successful authentication, you will receive a JWT token that needs to be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests.

## Endpoints

### Endpoint 1

- **URL:** `/api/endpoint1`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** This endpoint retrieves the data for endpoint 1.
- **Parameters:**
  - `param1`: The first parameter.
  - `param2`: The second parameter.
- **Response:**
  - `200 OK`: Returns the data for endpoint 1 in JSON format.
  - `404 Not Found`: If the requested data is not found.

### Endpoint 2

- **URL:** `/api/endpoint2`
- **Method:** POST
- **Description:** This endpoint creates a new resource for endpoint 2.
- **Parameters:**
  - `param1`: The first parameter.
  - `param2`: The second parameter.
- **Request Body:**
  - JSON object containing the data for the new resource.
- **Response:**
  - `201 Created`: If the resource is successfully created.
  - `400 Bad Request`: If the request is invalid.

### Endpoint 3

- **URL:** `/api/endpoint3/{id}`
- **Method:** DELETE
- **Description:** This endpoint deletes the resource with the specified ID.
- **Parameters:**
  - `id`: The ID of the resource to be deleted.
- **Response:**
  - `204 No Content`: If the resource is successfully deleted.
  - `404 Not Found`: If the resource with the specified ID is not found.

## Request/Response Formats

All requests and responses are in JSON format. The request body should follow a specific format depending on the endpoint being called. The response body will contain the requested data or an error message if applicable.

## Error Handling

In case of errors, the API will return an appropriate HTTP status code along with an error message in the response body. The error message will provide details about the encountered error, helping you to identify and resolve the issue.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the API endpoints:

1. Retrieve data from Endpoint 1:
  ```
  GET /api/endpoint1?param1=value1&param2=value2
  ```

2. Create a new resource for Endpoint 2:
  ```
  POST /api/endpoint2
  {
    "param1": "value1",
    "param2": "value2"
  }
  ```

3. Delete a resource from Endpoint 3:
  ```
  DELETE /api/endpoint3/123
  ```
